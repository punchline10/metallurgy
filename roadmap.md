# Development Roadmap

## Due July 29:
- Colin:
  - Basic sampler functionality
    - Input: midi file
    - Target: audio file (wav)
    - Translates midi timing data to audio timing data
    - Initial version uses only one note
- Keon:
  - Basic onset detection
    - Input: audio file
    - Target: midi file
    - Performs onset detection (to get onset timing)
    - Converts timing data to timing for midi file
    - Initial version just uses C5 (midi note number 72), pitch detection to be added later
